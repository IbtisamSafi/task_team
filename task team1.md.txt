# BareBits Team
#### 1.Reason for naming :
##### *MareBits 🐎 :
###### At first, dealing with a horse or riding it is very difficult—you need patience.
###### But once you get used to it,s things becomse easier and more enjoyable, and you start to realize how strong the bond between a human and a horse can be.
###### It’s the same with this course or when learning something new. In the beginning,
###### it’s tough and requires patience. But over time, God willing, it will become more fun and easier. And as we dive deeper, we’ll discover how strong the connection is between software engineering  concepts and the world of technology

#### 2.Communication Rules :
1.Mutual Respect
   - Use a polite tone and avoid sarcasm or belittling others' efforts.
2. Message Interaction
   - Use emojis like 👍 or ✅ to confirm receipt or agreement instead of sending "Received".

3. Appropriate Timing
   - Avoid sending non-urgent messages late at night or during the team's time off.
4. Message Clarity
   - Format your messages with a title, bullet points, and links.
   - Don’t send vague messages like “Can I ask a question?”—just ask directly
5. Avoid sending messages to everyone without a specific purpose.
- Use @channel or only for important matters.

6. Keep options updated.
- Inform your team of any delays or progress through the designated announcement channel.
7. Respect personal space.
- Avoid excessive direct messages (DMs) unless absolutely necessary.

8. Respond to threads.

- Use the "thread" feature instead of writing a direct reply to each message.

#### 3.Key Criteria for Writing Clean Code:

 1. Meaningful Names: Use names for variables, functions, and classes that reveal intent and are easily searchable.

 2. Small Functions: Functions must be small (and even smaller!) and perform only one single task at one level of abstraction.

 3. No Redundant Comments: Code should be self-documenting; comments are not a substitute for poorly written code.

 4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Classes should be responsible for one thing only (one reason to change).

 5. Effective Error Handling: Use exceptions instead of return codes, and strictly avoid passing or returning Null.

 6. Clean Unit Tests: Write fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and timely (F.I.R.S.T) unit tests.

 #### 4.Branch: Purpose & Idea

 What’s a Branch in Programming?
  ..... Branch: Purpose & Idea
 A branch is used when you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, and its main purpose is to let you work on a separate version of the project without affecting the original (main) version.
 It’s like opening a safe space where you can test and develop freely. Every change or idea happens there—without risk.
 Once you're done and everything works well, you merge it back into the main branch. That way, your work stays clean and organized.

 Why is branching important?
 Because it helps teams collaborate without conflicts. Everyone can work on different parts of the project at the same time without stepping on each other’s toes.
 And if something goes wrong, it’s easy to go back without messing up the rest of the app.

 Simply put, branching is the smart way to work in coding! 💡💻
